## DAILY SCRUM

After Sprint Planning, Team has to go though some daily processes otherwise called Daily Scrum.
The development team uses Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint goal.
The reason behind it is that it helps to set up the context for the work that needs to be done during the whole day. This way the team syncronizes activities and collaborate with each other. Daily Scrum improves the Development Team's level of knowledge. 

These daily events (processes) consist on some points : 
##### 1. Tasks should be separated to subtasks 
Developer should seperate big tasks to subtasks that can be done daily. This step will help everyone organize their work and also help the Team Leader and Project Manager understand where what is done and what point every one is working with.
##### 2. Create a MR for each subtask 
   Developers should create a Merge request for each subtask they are assigned
##### 3. Communicating with the team 
   Every developer should communicate with each other or with the team leader if they have any difficulties of even raport to the product owner that everything is going ok. 
      3.1 IF HELP IS NEEDED - Another team member works with the task 
###### 4 Review
   After finishing the task everyone notifies, and every team member should review the code of each other. 
   ThIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!
