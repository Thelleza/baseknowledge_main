## User story example

---

#### Description:

This is an example of a user story, how it can be written, organized with some best practises.
<br>
The user story is a general example of a product backlog item, because some other examples may be _technical work_, _bugs_, _use cases_, etc, but all, is best practise to share the same methodology of communication.
<br>
The most important thing of a clear description for a user story is the **value** or the **increment** it provides to the product, offering participants of the _us_ the direction
to seek the optimized solutions on how to increment.
It should be writen as a user is telling us what wants to see when interacting with the sistem.

#### Acceptance criteria:

As described in scrum one of the most important aspects of the methodology is the definition of "Done". There are practices where the definition of done is specified in one document and is general for the project or maybe for the whole teams, but can also be specified per _us_, according to the situation. The best practises show that each user story also specify a list of uses cases which, the quality assurance participants will test, to mark the user story as complete. The list can be shown as below:

- When you read the "Description" section and you think is a little bit longer than standart, this user story must be marked as **unclear**
- When you see a Acceptance criteria which is not listed, you will think as poorly documented
- If you dont see technical details section below, please move this task to "TODO" column.

#### Technical details:

Some task must provide also technicau
Some techincal details we will describe here is the lifecycle of a **US**:
It has some phases in which it pass throw before it's considered as done.
<br>

- TODO: It is in the sprint backlog
- In progress: When a developer takes(or is assigned to) to develop it.
- Waiting Review: When the task is waiting technical review.
- Merged(Ready to deploy): When is passed the review and is merged
- Deployed(Waiting for QA): Deployed on staging
- Testing (Quality Assurance in progess): When it si being tested.
- Done

> @all

> MR: `http:://link/of/mr`<br>
> Reviewers: @user1 (code), @user2(functionality), @user3(architecture review)

> Review: OK<br>
> Deployer: @user4

> Deployed: `http://link/to/staging`<br>
> Tester: @user8

> Tested: OK<br>

> QA Tested: Failed<br>
